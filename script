Encrypt Emails

Why bother?

* well. if you need to send private information via the conventional mail, you'd  probably put it in a sealed envelope
* you don't want your bank sending your balance and stuff on a postcard. or you
 wouldn't want that leaks sent to you get in the wrong hands and your sources
 get compromised
* normal email is like using post cards
* when it was designed, maliscious use and privacy were not on people's minds
* so with standard email you face 2 potential problems:
  * anyone with a bit of knowledge can intercept and read your message
  * anyone could impersonate you and write messages in your name to 3rd parties
  * you can't be really sure that the mail coming from alice@... is really from alice

* How does email encryption solve this?
  ** you can encrypt mail meant for particular receivers so that only they are
  able to decrypt it and read its contents
  ** you can digitally sign the mail you send which insures others that the
  you really were the author of the mail
* How does it work?
  ** the technique is based on mathematical operations with large numbers
  ** it's called asymmetric encryption, because it uses a pair of 2 keys
  ** there's the public key you distribute to anyone who will be writing to you
  ** they can use it to encrypt the messages meant for you
  ** only you will be able to decrypt them because only you have your private
  key
  ** you should be really really careful with your private key. never give it
  away or put it in a place where others can access it
  ** it is a good idea to make a backup of you keypair. if you lose your
  private key, you won't be able to access your encrypted messages anymore
  ** you can also use your private key to digitally sign mail you send out
  ** the recepients who have your public key would be able to verify that the
  mail really came from you

* What does email encryption _not_ solve?
  ** People interested in your communication can still see whom are you talking
  to when (and read the subject line of the mail); this is the so called meta
  data. and in some cases this really is more than enough
