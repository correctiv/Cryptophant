> "Arguing that you don't care about privacy because you have nothing to hide
> is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have
> nothing to say." -- Edward Snowden

### Problems with unencrypted email

* not private
* doesn't guarantee the identity of the sender

---

### How does email encryption solve this?

* you can encrypt mail meant for particular recepients so that only they are able to decrypt it and read its contents
* you can digitally sign the mail you send which insures others that the you really were the author of the mail

---

### How does it work?

* mathematical operations with large numbers
* asymmetric encryption: uses a pair of 2 keys
* public key: you distribute it to anyone who will be writing to you
* private key: you use it to decrypt the messages
* keep your private key private
* make a backup

---

### What does email encryption _not_ solve?

* who are you talking to when
* subject line

---
